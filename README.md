# RestApi

The application will be a simple REST API server that will expose endpoints to allow accessing and manipulating ‘user’. The operations that our endpoint will allow include:

Creating a new user,
Updating an existing user,
Deleting an existing user,
Fetching an existing user, and
Fetching a list of users.

Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher for matching incoming requests to their respective handler.
